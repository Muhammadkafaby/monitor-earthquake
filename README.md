## üîß Customization

### Animation Settings
Animations can be customized in component files using Framer Motion:
```typescript
// Example: Customize card hover animation
whileHover={{ 
  scale: 1.02, 
  y: -4,
  boxShadow: "0 20px 40px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15)"
}}
```

### Map Marker Customization
Advanced marker styling in `src/components/EarthquakeMap.tsx`:
```typescript
const createAdvancedMagnitudeMarker = (magnitude: number, isRecent: boolean) => {
  const baseSize = Math.max(24, Math.min(60, magnitude * 8));
  // Customize size calculation, colors, and animations here
};
```

### Color System
Comprehensive color system in `src/utils/earthquakeUtils.ts`:
```typescript
const getMarkerColors = (mag: number) => {
  if (mag >= 7) return { bg: '#dc2626', border: '#991b1b', glow: '#fca5a5' };
  // Customize color mappings here
};
```

### Dark Mode Theming
Dark mode colors can be customized throughout the components using Tailwind's dark mode classes:
```typescript
className={`transition-colors duration-300 ${
  darkMode 
    ? 'bg-gray-800 text-white' 
    : 'bg-white text-gray-900'
}`}
```

## üôè Acknowledgments

- **USGS** for providing free, real-time earthquake data
- **OpenStreetMap** for providing free map tiles
- **Leaflet** for the excellent mapping library
- **React Leaflet** for React integration
- **Framer Motion** for advanced animation capabilities
- **Tailwind CSS** for the utility-first CSS framework
- **Lucide** for the beautiful icon set
- **Vite** for the fast development experience

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Map Not Loading**: Ensure you have a stable internet connection for loading map tiles from OpenStreetMap.

2. **Animations Performance**: If animations are slow on older devices, they will automatically reduce motion based on user preferences.

3. **CORS Errors**: The USGS API supports CORS, but if you encounter issues, ensure you're accessing the site via HTTP/HTTPS, not file:// protocol.

4. **Data Not Loading**: Check your internet connection and ensure the USGS API is accessible. The application will show an error message with a retry button.

5. **Dark Mode Issues**: Dark mode state is managed in the main App component and passed down to all child components.

### Performance Optimization

1. **Large Dataset Performance**: The application handles large datasets efficiently with staggered animations and optimized rendering.

2. **Mobile Performance**: Animations are optimized for mobile devices with reduced complexity when needed.

3. **Memory Management**: Components properly clean up animations and event listeners.

### Development

```bash
# Check for linting issues
npm run lint

# Build and test production bundle
npm run build && npm run preview
```

### Animation-specific Troubleshooting

1. **Framer Motion Issues**: Ensure all animated components are properly wrapped with motion elements.

2. **Animation Performance**: Use `will-change` CSS property sparingly and let Framer Motion handle optimization.

3. **Reduced Motion**: The application respects user's `prefers-reduced-motion` settings.
